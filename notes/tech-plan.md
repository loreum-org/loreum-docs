# **Loreum Network: Technical Architecture Overview**

The Loreum Network functions as a **blockchain-based reputation network** for **nodes specialized in handling LLM prompt responses**, enriched with **local sensors and agents** that power a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system**. This architecture ensures **decentralization, efficiency, and specialization-based reputation scoring**.

---

## **1. High-Level Architecture**
The **Loreum Network** comprises **three core layers**:

1. **Execution & Consensus Layer (Blockchain)**
   - Responsible for **reputation tracking, rewards, and governance**.
   - Uses **Ethereum Layer 2 (Optimism or EigenLayer) with ZK-Rollups** for scalability.
   - Implements a **custom reputation mechanism** based on response quality, node reliability, and user feedback.

2. **Knowledge & Retrieval Layer (Distributed RAG + Vector DB)**
   - Nodes maintain **local vector databases** with specialized knowledge.
   - Queries are routed **based on reputation and sensor/agent specialization**.
   - Uses **EigenDA for decentralized data availability**.

3. **Interaction Layer (P2P Node Network)**
   - Nodes **register specialization metadata** (e.g., medical AI, financial analysis, legal GPT).
   - Query routing is optimized by a **distributed index** of expertise.
   - Implemented using **libp2p and gRPC** for fast, secure communication.

## **2. Core Components**

### **A. Blockchain Layer (Reputation & Consensus)**
- **Purpose**: Tracks node reputation, ensures trustless collaboration.
- **Tech Stack**:
  - **Ethereum L2 (Optimism or ZK-Rollups)**
  - Smart contracts for:
    - **Reputation scoring**
    - **Query payment mechanisms (LORE token)**
    - **Node registration & staking**
- **Reputation System**:
  - **Positive Feedback**:
    - Accurate, fast, high-quality LLM responses.
    - Consistently available and reliable sensors/agents.
  - **Negative Penalties**:
    - Slow or incorrect responses.
    - Node downtime or malicious activity.
  - **Scoring Based On**:
    - Query response time.
    - Query complexity.
    - Peer-validation and challenge-response mechanisms.

### **B. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Layer**
- **Purpose**: Ensures LLMs have **access to real-time, domain-specific data**.
- **Tech Stack**:
  - **Vector Databases**: Weaviate, Qdrant, or FAISS (locally on each node).
  - **Embedding Models**: OpenAI, Mistral, or local fine-tuned LLMs.
  - **Data Sources**:
    - **Local sensors (fetch-based or real-time)**
    - **Chamber agents (modular AI models)**.
  - **Decentralized Query Routing**:
    - Queries are **split across multiple nodes** based on **expertise & reputation**.
    - Uses **EigenDA for secure, tamper-proof query logging**.
  - **Cache Layer**:
    - Implements a **time-sensitive Redis-based cache** for frequently requested prompts.
    - Reduces redundant computation and optimizes response speed.

---

### **C. Sensor & Agent Hub**
- **Purpose**: Provides **real-world, domain-specific data** to enhance responses.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Modular & Plug-and-Play Design**:
    - Nodes **attach domain-specific sensors** (financial feeds, medical APIs, Web3 on-chain data).
  - **Async Event Processing**:
    - Sensor data ingestion **via WebSockets & gRPC**.
    - LLM **fetches relevant real-time data** before generating responses.
  - **Multi-Agent Collaboration**:
    - Nodes can **delegate specialized sub-queries** to other agent-enabled nodes.
    - Allows composition of **multi-step, multi-domain reasoning**.

---

### **D. P2P Network & Query Routing**
- **Purpose**: Efficiently **routes user prompts** to the most relevant nodes.
- **Tech Stack**:
  - **libp2p**: Secure peer-to-peer communication.
  - **GossipSub Protocol**: For efficient query broadcast.
  - **DHT-based Distributed Index**:
    - Nodes **register expertise & performance metrics**.
    - Queries are routed **based on reputation score & specialization**.
- **Workflow**:
  1. **User sends a query** to the network.
  2. Query is **hashed & matched** to relevant nodes **via DHT lookup**.
  3. Top-ranked nodes **respond**, and **responses are peer-validated**.
  4. Best response is **selected & reputation is updated**.

---

## **3. Query Execution Flow**
1. **User submits a query** (e.g., "Summarize today's DeFi market trends").
2. Query is **broadcasted across the P2P network**.
3. **Top-ranked nodes** (with DeFi expertise) **compete to provide the best response**.
4. Nodes **fetch data from their local sensors & vector DBs**.
5. RAG-enhanced response is generated **using both local & global context**.
6. Responses are **peer-reviewed** before final selection.
7. The **best response is returned**, and the **winning node gets rewarded**.

---

## **4. Economic Model (Tokenized Incentives)**
- **Token (LORE) Usage**:
  - Users pay **LORE tokens** per query.
  - Nodes **stake LORE to participate**, earning **rewards based on reputation**.
  - Reputation-based **query prioritization & staking slashing** for bad responses.
- **Revenue Streams**:
  - Query fees.
  - API access to **high-reputation nodes**.
  - Node-to-node **query monetization**.

---

## **5. Key Advantages**
✅ **Decentralized Query Execution** – No single point of failure.  
✅ **Specialized Reputation Network** – Queries go to **top-performing nodes**.  
✅ **LLM+RAG+Sensors for Real-Time Responses** – Combines static & live data.  
✅ **Tokenized Incentives & Governance** – Ensures **honest & performant nodes**.  
✅ **Scalability via Rollups & P2P Indexing** – High-speed, low-cost execution.
