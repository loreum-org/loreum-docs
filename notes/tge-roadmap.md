## **📌 TGE Timing Options**

| Option | Timing | Pros | Cons |
|--------|--------|------|------|

| **✅ Ideal (Q3 - Q4 2025)** | Post-testnet | - Testnet validates demand <br> - De-risked investment <br> - Allows staking & incentives to start | - Requires patience for traction |
| **⏳ Delayed (Q1 2026+)** | Post-mainnet | - Fully proven utility <br> - Stronger adoption signals | - Might miss early excitement <br> - Harder to raise funds |
