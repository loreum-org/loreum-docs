# Network

The Loreum Network blockchain essentially acts as a global index, enabling a decentralized and distributed query system. When you start a Loreum Node on your device, it syncs with this network and provides you with access to a vast, queryable index. Prompts sent through this network are intelligently routed to the most suitable nodes based on their sensor or agent capabilities and reputation. This setup ensures that the network is robust and adaptive.
