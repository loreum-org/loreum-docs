# Governance Mechanism

## Leadership Structure

The Chamber implements an innovative leaderboard system that dynamically adjusts to changing delegation patterns. Token holders can delegate their voting power to specific NFT IDs, creating a fluid power structure that responds to market signals. Leadership positions are determined algorithmically based on the volume of delegated tokens, ensuring that influence is proportional to community trust.

The system allocates board seats based on relative delegation amounts, with the top token-weighted positions receiving director status. Critical decisions require approval from directors controlling at least 51% of the delegated voting power, ensuring strong consensus for important actions.

## Market-Driven Governance

The Chamber implements a futarchic governance model through its delegation mechanism, creating a continuous market for leadership positions. Token holders can delegate their governance power to any NFT ID within the system, with these delegations being tracked through a sophisticated double-entry bookkeeping system. The delegation weights determine leadership positions in real-time, with the top N positions by weight receiving director status and associated transaction approval rights.

This market-driven approach creates natural selection pressure for effective leadership, as token holders can fluidly reallocate their delegation in response to performance. The system maintains atomic consistency through reentrancy protection and ensures that all delegated power can be withdrawn immediately if needed, creating a responsive governance mechanism that can rapidly adapt to changing conditions.

## SubDAO Architecture

The system supports the creation and management of SubDAOs that can operate with varying degrees of autonomy while maintaining connection to the parent Chamber. Each SubDAO Chamber maintains its own treasury and AI agents while inheriting governance parameters from the parent Chamber. Cross-Chamber coordination mechanisms enable complex multi-entity governance arrangements while maintaining clear lines of authority and responsibility.

This hierarchical structure enables:
- Specialized governance for different operational domains
- Isolated treasury management with parent oversight
- Domain-specific AI agent deployment
- Coordinated multi-chamber governance actions

## Technical Implementation

The Chamber's core functionality is implemented through several key mechanisms:

### Board Structure
- Maintains a sorted doubly-linked list of nodes
- Each node tracks tokenId, amount, and list position
- Automatic reordering on delegation changes
- O(n) insertion and removal operations

### Wallet Operations
- Multi-signature transaction submission and execution
- Batch transaction support for efficient operations
- Confirmation tracking per director
- Revocable transaction confirmations
