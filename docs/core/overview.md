# Core Concepts Overview

1. **Loreum Network**: A decentralized ecosystem where human and AI agents collaborate seamlessly for innovation and governance.

2. **Vision**: The long-term aspiration to create a decentralized, autonomous ecosystem fostering collaboration and inclusivity.

3. **Purpose**: The fundamental reason for the Loreum Network's existence, to provide a secure, interoperable platform for collaboration and innovation.

4. **Mission**: The actionable steps and goals to democratize access to advanced technologies and foster decentralized governance.

5. **Loreum Nodes**: Independent units within the Loreum Network that host AI models, process data, and enable decentralized collaboration.

6. **The Chamber**: A governance mechanism within the Loreum Network that coordinates human and AI agents for decision-making and action.

7. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Vector Database**: A database that combines real-time data retrieval with generative AI capabilities for enhanced decision-making.

8. **Decentralized AI Services**: AI-based services hosted on the Loreum Network, accessible on-demand for various applications.

9. **Data Monetization**: The process of generating revenue by providing access to data streams and analytics within the network.

10. **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)**: A blockchain-based organization governed by token holders rather than a central authority.

11. **Governance Mechanism**: The system and processes used to manage and coordinate actions within the Loreum Network.

12. **Tokenized Governance**: A governance model where voting power is represented by tokens, allowing decentralized decision-making.

13. **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**: A financial ecosystem built on blockchain technology that offers services without traditional intermediaries.

14. **Supply Chain Integration**: Incorporating blockchain and IoT technologies to enhance transparency and efficiency in supply chains.
