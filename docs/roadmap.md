# Loreum Strategic Roadmap

## **Overview**
The Loreum network is being developed with a phased roadmap to ensure a robust, decentralized, and scalable AI-powered query network. This roadmap aligns with key milestones, including the **Token Generation Event (TGE)** to ensure financial and community support.

---

## **Roadmap Phases**

### **Phase 1: Foundation & Architecture (Q1 - Q2 2025)**
**Goal**: Establish core architecture, protocols, and infrastructure for Loreum's P2P network, RAG system, and reputation-based query routing.

#### **Technical Priorities**
- ‚è≥ Finalize **Loreum Cortex architecture** (modular sensor-agent framework)
- ‚è≥ Implement **P2P network using libp2p** for distributed RAG querying
- ‚è≥ Develop **local vector database integration** for each node
- ‚è≥ Design **reputation system** (ranking nodes based on accuracy, reliability, and specialization)
- ‚è≥ Implement **EigenDA** for decentralized storage

#### **Business & Governance**
- ‚è≥ Draft **whitepaper & technical documentation**
- ‚è≥ Define **tokenomics model** (LORE staking for reputation & network security)
- ‚è≥ Establish **early partnerships** (AI, DeFi, and data-driven applications)
- ‚è≥ Begin **community-building efforts** (developer outreach & incentives)

---

### **Phase 2: Prototype & Network Expansion (Q3 - Q4 2025)**
**Goal**: Deploy the first testnet, onboard early adopters, and refine node reputation & governance mechanisms.

#### **Technical Priorities**
- ‚è≥ Launch **Loreum Testnet** (early node operators onboarded)
- ‚è≥ Implement **distributed reputation scoring algorithm**
- ‚è≥ Develop **query routing mechanism** (nodes receive queries based on specialization & ranking)
- ‚è≥ Build **sensor & agent marketplace** (nodes can create and sell query-processing modules)
- ‚è≥ Enable **multi-node query aggregation** for complex responses

#### **Business & Ecosystem**
- ‚è≥ Run **pilot programs** (DeFi analytics, AI-driven insights, etc.)
- ‚è≥ Onboard **early validators & data providers**
- ‚è≥ Conduct **first funding round** (strategic investors & grants)

---

### **Phase 3: Mainnet Launch & Ecosystem Growth (Q1 - Q2 2026)**
**Goal**: Deploy the full Loreum network, activate token utility, and expand to various industries.

#### **Technical Priorities**
- ‚è≥ **Mainnet deployment** of Loreum Cortex and reputation-based query routing
- ‚è≥ Launch **Lore token staking & incentive system**
- ‚è≥ Enable **cross-node query monetization** (nodes get paid for processing queries)
- ‚è≥ Optimize **scalability & efficiency** (adaptive reputation & cost-based query routing)

#### **Business & Adoption**
- ‚è≥ Integrate with **DeFi, AI services, and enterprise clients**
- ‚è≥ Expand **agent & sensor marketplace** for broader utility
- ‚è≥ Launch **community-driven funding & governance**
- ‚è≥ Begin **developer grants & hackathons** to foster innovation

---

### **Phase 4: Decentralization & Sustainability (Q3 - Q4 2026)**
**Goal**: Achieve full decentralization, optimize performance, and establish a self-sustaining economy.

#### **Technical Priorities**
- ‚è≥ Implement **trustless governance mechanisms** (Chamber-based decision-making)
- ‚è≥ Enable **cross-network interoperability** (connecting Loreum to external AI & blockchain networks)
- ‚è≥ Enhance **node incentives & economic sustainability** (optimize revenue model for node operators)

#### **Business & Long-Term Vision**
- ‚è≥ Scale to **global adoption** across industries
- ‚è≥ Expand into **multi-chain interoperability**
- ‚è≥ Implement **on-chain AI governance & decision-making**
- ‚è≥ Develop **AI-driven reputation scoring** for fully autonomous network curation

---

## **Token Generation Event (TGE) Strategy**

### **üìç Best Time for TGE: Late Q3 or Early Q4 2025**
This ensures:
- A functioning **testnet** validating the network‚Äôs capabilities.
- A clear **utility model** for staking, governance, and rewards.
- Adoption signals through **early partnerships & node operators**.
- A de-risked **investment narrative** for private & public rounds.

#### **Pre-TGE Preparation (Q2 - Q3 2025)**
- ‚è≥ **Finalize tokenomics** (staking, governance, rewards)
- ‚è≥ **Launch testnet** with reputation-based incentives
- ‚è≥ **Build hype with early partnerships & community**
- ‚è≥ **Secure private investments or strategic partners**
- ‚è≥ **Ensure compliance with regulations**

#### **TGE Event (Q3 - Q4 2025)**
- ‚è≥ **Raise funds via token sale** (private & public rounds)
- ‚è≥ **Launch staking & reputation incentives**
- ‚è≥ **Ensure liquidity provision & market-making strategies**
- ‚è≥ **List on DEXs first, CEXs later (if needed)**

#### **Post-TGE Execution (Q4 2025 - Q1 2026)**
- ‚è≥ **Transition from testnet ‚Üí mainnet**
- ‚è≥ **Distribute early staking rewards**
- ‚è≥ **Expand ecosystem adoption (DApps, agents, sensors)**
