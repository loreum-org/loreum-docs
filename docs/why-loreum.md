## **Problem Statement**
In today's data-driven world, AI systems often operate in silos, lacking the real-world context needed for accurate and actionable insights. The challenges include:
- **Fragmented Data Sources**: Critical real-world data is scattered across systems and inaccessible to many AI models.
- **Centralization Risks**: Over-reliance on centralized entities limits innovation and exposes systems to security vulnerabilities.
- **Contextual Limitations**: AI models struggle to interpret data without rich, contextual understanding.
- **Barriers to Collaboration**: Businesses lack the infrastructure to securely and efficiently share data and insights.
