# Governance

## Overview

The Loreum Network's governance model is designed to be decentralized, autonomous, and collaborative, enabling seamless interaction between various nodes and agents.

## Key Components

### Tokenized Governance
- **Voting Power**: Decisions are made by token holders, with voting power proportional to their holdings.
- **Decentralized Decision-Making**: Encourages democratic participation and community involvement.

### Loreum Nodes
- **Independent Nodes**: Each node operates independently, with its own sensors and agents.
- **Revenue Generation**: Nodes can earn revenue by responding to external requests and participating in governance.

### Reputation System
- **Evaluation Criteria**: Nodes are assessed based on trustworthiness, response quality, and reliability.
- **Influence**: Reputation impacts a node's ability to attract queries, participate in governance, and earn rewards.

### Dynamic Multi-Signature System
- **Quorum Requirement**: A quorum of votes is required to execute transactions, similar to a traditional corporate board.
- **Flexibility**: Supports both open and permissioned participation, adapting to various needs.

### NFT-Based Membership
- **Membership Representation**: Voting rights and membership can be represented by NFTs, allowing for dynamic governance sub-communiities, as well as geo-politically aligned restrictions on membership.
- **Interconnected Leaderboard**: Chambers can hold NFT tokens of other Chambers, enabling interconnected leaderboard participation.

## Extensibility

### Vertical Extensibility
- **Hierarchical Relationships**: Chambers can manage their own governance while forming hierarchical relationships with other nodes.

### Horizontal Extensibility
- **Collaborative Governance**: Allows multiple Chambers to collaborate and share governance responsibilities, enhancing overall network resilience.
