# Abstract


Loreum is a Smart Account framework that integrates artificial intelligence agents with decentralized capital management and directorship. By combining AI agents with on-chain smart contract systems, Loreum addresses fundamental limitations in traditional corporate and DAO governance structures. The system introduces a novel Chamber architecture that enables dynamic, market-driven governance while maintaining human oversight through a unique delegation mechanism.

Traditional organizational governance faces significant challenges in coordination efficiency and decision-making processes. These limitations are particularly evident in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), where governance often becomes bottlenecked by human coordination challenges. Loreum addresses these limitations by introducing an AI-enhanced governance framework that maintains human oversight while leveraging algorithmic precision in decision-making.
